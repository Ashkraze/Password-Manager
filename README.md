# Password-Manager
Developed a password directory to store passwords using Python and using Tkinter for User Interface.
Passwords are stored in a txt file at location of your choosing before storing the password the user input password goes through an encryption process and the encrypted password is stored in the txt file.
On user demand password can be extracted which will present it to the user in its original form, that is after decryption of the saved encrypted password.
