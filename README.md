# Password-Manager
Developed a Password Directory: Created a secure application to store and manage passwords.
Programming Language: Utilized Python for backend logic.
User Interface: Implemented using Tkinter for a user-friendly experience.

Password Storage:
Passwords are stored in a text file.
The storage location is chosen by the user, providing flexibility and control.

Encryption Process:
Before storing, the user-inputted password undergoes an encryption process.
This ensures that passwords are not stored in plain text, enhancing security.

Encrypted Storage:
The encrypted password is saved in the text file.
This adds an additional layer of security to the stored data.

Password Retrieval:
On user demand, the stored password can be extracted.
The application decrypts the saved encrypted password.
The decrypted password is then presented to the user in its original form.
